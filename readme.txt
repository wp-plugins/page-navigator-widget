This plugin is a replacement for the standard Page widget, that works how you want it to do. 

== Description ==

This plugin works like the standard Page widget, however this one works how you want it to do. 

= The menu unfolds sub-items as required =

This plugin displays initially the pages menu top-level pages only.
While on a page, the child pages that belong to the page are also listed.
While on a child-page, the subsequent grand-child pages are listed also.
Etc. as deeply as reuired.

= Extra features =

Additionally a Home-link can be added that will display conditionally.
You can select from: Always, On a page only, Never.
When On a page only is selected, the Home link will display ony when you are on a page, so when you might need it.

The advantage of this plugin is that a huge amount of pages can be in a menu, without the user getting lost as long as you provide a proper tree-structure to them.

= Also included =

The standard configurability of Widget title, Excluded pages, Sort order.
